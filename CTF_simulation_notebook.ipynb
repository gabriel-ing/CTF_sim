    "# CTF simulation notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows the effect of various parameters on the contrast transfer function in transmission electron microscopy. While the code is all my own, the equations were taken from an excel spreadsheet by Henning Stahlberg (Henning.Stahlberg@unibas.ch, Sept 2020, http://c-cina.orgÂ© Henning Stahlberg, Henning.Stahlberg@unibas.ch, Sept 2020, http://c-cina.org). This spreadsheet can be downloaded from [here](https://www.c-cina.org/oldlbem/research/research/methods/software/ctf-simulation/https://www.c-cina.org/oldlbem/research/research/methods/software/ctf-simulation/) and was a great influence in this work. The creation of this was also heavily influenced by an [ipython notebook](https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/blob/master/nb/2d_class_fourier.ipynb) found on [Geoff Wollard's github](https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/tree/masterhttps://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/tree/master), which is excellent. Although I didn't directly take any of the code from here, it was a big influence is definitely worth checking out if you are interested! \n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to highlight some things to consider with the plotting, and then below discuss some of points that this plotting has helped me understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pixel Size slider is for the 2D power spectrum** - It will affect all of the plots because of how I have made them. Changing the pixel size is essentially just increasing the sampling of the plot, so for the 1D plot, a higher sampling rate leads to a perfectly formed plot. The transformed image is multiplied (in the frequency domain) by the 2D power spectrum, so the changes in the image are due to the changes in this. The image should zoom in and out with changes in the magnification, however I chose to ignore this. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The CTF is always a dampened sine wave** - With a small pixel size the 2D plot can start to look very ugly, with sharp corners and sometimes skipping one of the peaks or troughs of the wave. This is an artefact of undersamping of the plot. Increasing the pixel size adjusts how many points there are, and will show a much cleaner plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**High defocus gives better contrast but worse resolution** - Well this probably won't be a new lesson for experinced TEM users, but its nice to simulate the effect. High defocus dampens the CTF at high resolutions, but it also shifts the first peak to lower resolution values, increasing the contrast for low resolutions. This affect can dramatically increase contrast, but the image does look pretty blurry...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lower voltages also give better contrast but worse resolution** - This point is quite striking, to maximise contrast at low resolutions turn the voltage down to the minimum (here I allow 80kV). Importantly however, other factors are also at play when this is done in real life, for example higher energy (voltage) electron beams are able to penetrate samples further, meaning that this only holds true for thin samples. Lower voltage also leads to increased electron scattering ('lower voltage gives higher image contrast, due to the larger elastic-scattering cross section (proportional to 1/v2 where v is electron speed)' - [Egerton, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399114000424#:~:text=An%20accelerating%20voltage%20of%20100,absence%20of%20lens%2Daberration%20correction.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The envelope function limits resolution** - The envelope function multiplies a sine wave (not plotted here) which describes the oscillations, to produce the accurate CTF, which is dampened as a function of resolution. The envelope function is primarily the affect of chromatic aberration which is the difference in focusing of different energy of electron beam. The effect of this aberration therefore depends on the accelerating voltage and the range of energies within the electron beam which is the energy spread. The energy spread depends on the electron source and is a major reason why field emission guns are better than lanthenum hexaboride crystals which are better than tungsten filaments. The envelope is majorly affected by: \n",

    "- Chromatic aberration constant (Cc)\n",
